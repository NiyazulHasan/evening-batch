Programming languages
======================
Diagram: programming

A language which is used to communicate between user and computer is called programming language.

Programming language acts like a mediator or interface between user and computer.

Programming language divided into two types.

1) Low Level Language 

2) High Level Language 


1) Low Level Language 
---------------------
A language which is understand by a computer easily is called low level language.

A language which is computer dependent is called low level language.

ex:
	Machine Language (Binary Language)
	Assembly Language(Symbolic Language) 

Advantages:

> A program writtens in low level language consumes less memory.

> It is more efficient when compare to high level language.

Disadvantages:

> It is a burdun on a programmer to remember the code.

> If anywhere error raised in our program locating and handling error becomes difficult.

> Modifications can't be done easily.

2) High Level Language 
----------------------
A language which understand by a user easily is called high level language.

A language which is user dependent is called high level language.

Ex:
	C++, Java, .Net, Python, Perl and etc.

High level language can't understand by a computer easily. We required translators.

We have three translators in programming language.

1) Assembler 

2) Compiler 

3) Interpreter  

Advantages:

> It is easy to learn and easy to use because it is similar to english language.

> Debugging can be done easily.

> Modifications can be done easily.

Disadvantages:

> A program writtens in high level language consumes huge amount of memory.

> It requires translator.

> It is not efficient when compare to other languages.


Interview Questions
=====================

Q) What is Debugging?

Errors are also known as bugs.

The process of eliminating or removing the bugs from the application is called debugging.
