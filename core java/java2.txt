Comments in java
=================
Comments are created for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommended to use comments in our regular programming.

Comments will not display in output because they are not compiled by the compiler.

In java, we have two types of comments.

1) Single line comment 
--------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 


2) Multiple line comment 
------------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			multiple line comment 
		*/


Interview Question
-------------------

Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM?

JDK
----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

JDK is a installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar), document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development. 

JRE
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
It provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
----
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
JVM is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure.

History of Java
===============
In 1990, Sun Micro System took one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box. That time project was called Stealth project and later it is renamed to Green project. 

James Gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop the project and they have met in a placed called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with Graphic System. But James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages to develop the project.But the problem what they have face is C and C++ languages are system dependent. Then James gosling decided why don't we create our own programming language which is system independent.

In 1991 , they have developed a programming language called an OAK. OAK means strength , itself is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many contries like Germany , France, USA and etc.

Later in 1995, they have renamed OAK to JAVA. JAVA is a island of an Indonasia where first coffee of seed was produced and during the development of project they were consuming lot of coffee's.Hence symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.


Naming conventions in java
===========================
In java, uppercase letters will consider as different and lowercase letters will consider as different.Hence we consider java is a case sensitive programming language.

As java is a case sensitive ,we must and should follow naming conventions for following things.

ex:
	classes
	interfaces
	variables 
	methods 
	keywords 
	packages 
	constants 

classes
-------
In java, a class name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined classes		userdefined classes
	---------------			-----------------
	System				Test
	File				DemoApp
	FileWriter			ExampleApp
	BufferedReader 			MyFirstExample		
	and etc.			and etc.

interfaces
----------
In java, an interface name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined interfaces		userdefined interfaces
	---------------------		-----------------------
	Runnable			IDemoApp 
	Serializable			ITest
	ListIterator 			IExampleApp
	and etc.			and etc.


variables
----------
In java, a variable name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined variables		userdefined variables
	-------------------		---------------------
	out				empId	
	err				studName
	in 				deptNo
	length 				rollNo
	and etc.			and etc.

methods 
---------
In java, a method name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined methods		userdefined methods
	---------------			-------------------
	getPriority()			getDetails()
	setName()			setInfo()
	hashCode()			calculateBill()
	getClass()			showResult()
	and etc.			and etc.

keywords 
---------
In java, all keywords we need to write under lowercase letters only.
ex:
	predefined  keywords
	-------------------
	class, if, public, static, void, else, for and etc.

packages 
---------
In java, all packages we need to write under lowercase letters only.
ex:
	predefined packages	userdefined packages
	-----------------	-------------------
	java.lang		com.ihub.www	
	java.io			com.sadik.www
	java.util		com.qt.www
	java.sql		and etc.
	java.time 
	and etc.

constants 
---------
In java, all constants we need to write under uppercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined constants		userdefined constants
	-----------------------		---------------------
	MAX_PRIORITY 			LIMIT=10;	
	MIN_PRIORITY 
	NORM_PRIORITY 
	MAX_VALUE 
	MIN_VALUE
	and etc.
