Identifiers 
============
A name in java is called identifier.

It can be variable name, method name, class name or label name.

ex:
	class Test
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			int x = 10;

			System.out.println(x);	
		}
	}
	Here Test, main, args and x are identifiers.

Rules to declare an identifiers
-------------------------------
Rule1:
------
	Identifier will accept only following characters.
	ex:
		A-Z
		a-z
		0-9
		_
		$

Rule2:
------
	If we take other characters then we will get compile time error.
	ex:
		int  emp#id; //invalid 
		int  stud@fee; //invalid 
		int  emp_id; //valid
		int  emp$alary; //valid 
		
Rule3:
-----
	Identifier must and should starts with alphabets,underscore or dollar symbol 
	but not with digit.
	ex:
		int  a1234; //valid 
		int  _abcd; //valid 
		int  $=20;  //valid 
		int  1abcd; //invalid 

Rule4:
-----
	Every identifier is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int number;
		int NUMBER;
		int NumBer; 
Rule5:
------
	We can't take reserved words as an identifier name.
	ex:
		int if;
		int else;
		int for;

Rule6:
------
	There is no length limit for an identifier but it is not recommanded to take 
	more then 15 characters.


Reserved words
==============
There are some identifiers which are reserved to associate some functionality or meaning such type of identifiers are called reserved words.

Java support 53 reserved words.

In java, reserved words are divided into two types.

Datatypes
=========
Datatype describes what type of value we want to store inside a variable.

Datatype also tells how much memory has to be created for the variable.

In java, datatypes are divided into two types.

Diagram: java4.2


byte 
-----
It is a smallest datatype in java.

Size: 1 byte (8 bits)

Range : -128 to 127 (-2^7 to 2^7-1)

ex:
	1) byte b=130;
	   System.out.println(b); // C.T.E 

	2) byte b=10.56;
	   System.out.println(b); // C.T.E 

	3) byte b=40;
	   System.out.println(b); // 40
